# Flight_Live
The goal of the project is to create an application allowing to visualize in 3D on the terrestrial globe the position in real time of planes. This application is capable of retrieving information on aircraft flights from online data. It allows the user to filter and display only the planes that interest him. The user can also select a specific aircraft and obtain additional information such as its departure airport, its arrival airport, its speed, its trajectory, etc. In addition to the 3D view, a 2D interface will allow you to control the different viewing parameters and have access to the different functionalities.
